Causes the calling thread to enter an infinite loop, effectively hanging. 

This function is designed to make the calling thread enter an infinite loop, causing it to hang indefinitely. It serves as a simple way to stress test a thread that does not exit on its own and needs to be terminated externally. \Hypertarget{stress_8h_abaaeefe806d9f0dced0ea5a1f6f21fe5}\label{stress_8h_abaaeefe806d9f0dced0ea5a1f6f21fe5}

{\footnotesize\ttfamily void nohang (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}\item[{void}]{ }\end{DoxyParamCaption})}



Runs a non-\/blocking operation, allowing the calling thread to proceed without hanging. 

This function is designed to perform a non-\/blocking operation, allowing the calling thread to proceed without entering a hanging state. It is useful when you want to stress test an operation without blocking the execution flow of the calling thread. \Hypertarget{stress_8h_aed672bfe234aaab49f6bdbd655714f02}\label{stress_8h_aed672bfe234aaab49f6bdbd655714f02}

{\footnotesize\ttfamily void recur (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}\item[{void}]{ }\end{DoxyParamCaption})}



Recursively spawns itself 26 times, naming the spawned processes Gen\+\_\+A through Gen\+\_\+Z. 

The {\ttfamily recur} function recursively spawns itself 26 times, generating processes named Gen\+\_\+A through Gen\+\_\+Z. Each spawned process is block-\/waited by its parent.
